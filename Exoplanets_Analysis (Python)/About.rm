In this project, I analyzed a dataset containing information regarding some of the exoplanets founded by NASA. This analysis was done using Python pandas on a Windows laptop, but the project can be run on any machine supporting Python and Pandas. Besides pandas I also used matplotlib python module for visualization of this dataset. The project has 3 subsets: Reading, Analysis and Visualization. All these parts are further divided into menus for user friendly experience.
